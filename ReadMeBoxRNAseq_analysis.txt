RNA-seq analysis

rnaseq_analysis.R       - Analysis of normalized RNA-seq phenotypes
rnaseq_rankz_analysis.R - Analysis of rankz-transformed RNA-seq phenotypes
get_peaks.R             - Calculate LOD score peaks

rnaseq_peaks.rds        - LOD peaks > 5.5 (no more than 1 per chromosome) with normalized RNA-seq phenotypes
rnaseq_rankz_peaks.rds  - LOD peaks > 5.5 (no more than 1 per chromosome) with rankz-transformed RNA-seq phenotypes
